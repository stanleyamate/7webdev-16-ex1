        <li> 5 </li><!--using the addition operator-->

        <li> a number</li> <!--this is because it is considered as a number or the operant is a number.-->

        <li> true</li><!--because 3 being true makes the statement entirely to be true.-->

        <li>infinity</li><!--because it gives a very large number-->

        <li> NaN</li><!--becuase a number cant be divided by a word-->

        <li> false</li><!--because not a number is not a number so it cant be equal to anything which is not a number-->

        <li> number</li><!--technically a numeric datatype whose values cant be represented using numbers-->

        <li> true</li><!--it has to be true cos NaN is not a number so the test cant be true since its a test of NaN-->

        <li> 8</li> <!--its simply representing base of 2 to the power 3 i.e power law of indices-->

        <li> variable is declared called first_name and value is assigned to it using an equal-sign and that value is called Cindy which is written in qoutes</li>

        <li> it has no value yet</li>

        <li> undefined</li><!-- because a declared var cant be compared with its value given..its impossible-->

        <li> someperson</li><!--it automatcally merges the two words in the strings to become one-->

        <li> Bart Simpson</li><!--the quptes gives a spacing in between the first and last when merging is taking place-->

        <li> 4 </li><!--i guess its the number of letters in the word "cool"-->

        <li> true </li><!--every word or letter is specifically equal to itself-->

        <li> "string" </li><!--since they are character used to represent a text-->

        <li> 3Bob</li>

        <li> 5 </li>

        <li> 3 </li><!--this is because "2" is considered a as numeric datatype (i.e the numeric nature overshadows the string nature or datatype)so it simply performs its operation normal-->

        <li> NaN </li><!--this is simply because a word wont result to a direct number but that said it is still technically recognised a numeric datatype not expressed in numbers-->

        <li>
            var x;
            var y;

        </li>

        <li>true</li>
        <li>
            it has a series of characters to represent text and its wrapped my quotes
